	<h2>Declarative Rendering</h2>
	<p>{{ message }}</p>

	<!-- v-bind is called a directive -->
	<!-- Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is basically saying “keep this element’s title attribute up-to-date with the message property on the Vue instance.” -->
	<p><span v-bind:title="message_load_time">Hover over me</span></p>
	<!-- If you open up your JavaScript console again and enter app2.message = 'some new message', you’ll once again see that the bound HTML - in this case the title attribute - has been updated. -->





	<h2>Conditionals and Loops</h2>
	<p><span v-if="seen">Now you see me</span></p>
	<!-- Go ahead and enter app3.seen = false in the console. You should see the message disappear. -->

	<!-- Vue also provides a powerful transition effect:https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html system that can automatically apply transition effects when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue. -->

	<ol>
		<li v-for="todo in todos">
			{{ todo.text }}
		</li>
	</ol>
	<!-- In the console, enter app4.todos.push({ text: 'Finally launch the project' }). You should see a new item appended to the list. -->




	<h2>Handling User Input</h2>
	<p>{{ message }}</p>
	<button v-on:click="reverseMessage">Reverse Message</button>
	<!-- we update the state of our app without touching the DOM - all DOM manipulations are handled by Vue, and the code you write is focused on the underlying logic -->

	<!-- Vue also provides the v-model directive that makes two-way binding between form input and app state a breeze: -->



	<p>{{ message }}</p>
	<input type="text" v-model="message">



	<h2>Composing with Components</h2>
	<!-- it’s an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components. If we think about it, almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components: https://vuejs.org/images/components.png -->

	<ol>
		<!-- create an instance of the todo-item component -->
		<!--
      Now we provide each todo-item with the todo object
      it's representing, so that its content can be dynamic.
      We also need to provide each component with a "key",
      which will be explained later.
    -->
		<todo-item
			v-for="item in groceryList"
			v-bind:todo="item"
			v-bind:key="item.id"
		>
		</todo-item>
	</ol>
</div>

<script>

	// Define a new component called todo-item
	Vue.component('todo-item', {
		// The todo-item component now accepts a
	  // "prop", which is like a custom attribute.
	  // This prop is called todo.
		props: ['todo'],
		template: '<li>{{ todo.text }}</li>'
	})
